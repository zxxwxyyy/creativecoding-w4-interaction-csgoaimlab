This is Liqian Zhang's NYU Creative Coding Class W4 assignment interaction - CSGO aim lab. 
I am an FPS game lover & player, so I want to try to bring an Aim lab to the p5js platform. 
During my creation process, I have a problem with the 'move' buttons. When I clicked, the enemies ONLY move one frame. I tried all the way I can think, but all of them don't work. Thanks to Prof. Cotter telling me to always take a step back and showing me using boolean to solve this. Inspired by the boolean idea, I was able to add more buttons to control enemies' movement in a different mode and to finish this project. 
Left-click the mouse to fire, just like every FPS game. And simply interact with buttons to add/move the enemies, or you can hit the reset button to reset the map. 
Enjoy your aiming practice!
